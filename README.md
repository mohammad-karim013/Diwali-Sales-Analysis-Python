Hey there! I’m Mohammad Karim, and I’m passionate about turning raw sales data into actionable business insights.
This project is my deep dive into analyzing Diwali festive season sales to uncover customer behavior, top-selling products, and revenue trends — all using Python’s data analysis ecosystem.

This repo documents my entire journey, from data cleaning to visual storytelling.
