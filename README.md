---
Hey there! I’m Mohammad Karim, and I’m passionate about turning raw sales data into actionable business insights.
This project is my deep dive into analyzing Diwali festive season sales to uncover customer behavior, top-selling products, and revenue trends — all using Python’s data analysis ecosystem.

This repo documents my entire journey, from data cleaning to visual storytelling.

Analysis Workflow

This diagram outlines the step-by-step data flow:

Data Collection → Raw CSV/Excel festive season sales dataset

Data Cleaning & Preparation → Remove null values, fix data types, remove duplicates

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) → Statistical summaries, grouping, and aggregations

Visualization → Insights via Matplotlib & Seaborn charts

Business Insights → Actionable strategies for future festive seasons

**🎯 Motivation**

Festive impact on business: Diwali brings a massive surge in consumer spending — analyzing it helps optimize future campaigns.

Data storytelling: Numbers are just numbers unless they’re visualized and explained.

Hands-on Python: Perfect opportunity to use Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn in a real-world scenario.
